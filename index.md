# Schaefer Research Group
CCQC stands for the Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry. Here, our group does research at the intersection of chemistry, physics, and computer science. 
In particular, we use computational tools, such as wavefunction theory, to explore a molecule's energetics, structure, reactivity, and other properties in an
effort to achieve the highest accuracy possible.
