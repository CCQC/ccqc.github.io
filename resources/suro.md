## UGA SURO

The UGA Chemistry Department is soliciting applications from outstanding undergraduates who are majoring in chemistry and related disciplines for our Summer Undergraduate Research Opportunities (SURO) program. Students accepted into the SURO program will join active research groups and participate in projects directed by faculty members. These students will be introduced to new and innovative areas of research in a variety of chemistry sub-disciplines through close interaction with faculty members and exposure to other research within the department.

The program generally runs early June through early August, approx. 9 weeks. Participants will receive a generous stipend.

More information on SURO can be found at [UGA SURO website](https://www.suro-uga-chem.org/).

## UGA CURO

All UGA undergraduates – regardless of major – are eligible to enroll in CURO courses, take advantage of CURO funding, and submit abstracts for presentation at our annual Symposium. Students must have a UGA faculty mentor for all CURO offerings. The Schaefer group is willing to take hard-working, eager, and curious young researchers, just contact Prof. Schaefer (<ccq@uga.edu>). 

The CURO Honors Scholarship provides $3,000 in funding a year, renewable for up to four years. All incoming first-year UGA students interested in research in any field may apply.

Students from groups underrepresented in research are specifically encouraged to apply—this includes students from ethnic and racial minorities, students with financial need, students from rural areas, first-generation students, and students who anticipate working in underrepresented research disciplines. Prior research experience is not required.
